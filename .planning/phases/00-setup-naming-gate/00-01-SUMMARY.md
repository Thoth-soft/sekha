# Plan 00-01 Summary: Repository Scaffolding

## What Was Done

**Task 1 (local scaffolding) — COMPLETE:**
- Removed old empty `cortex/` directory
- Created `pyproject.toml` with hatchling, Python 3.11+, zero runtime dependencies, `name = "cyrus"`, `version = "0.0.0"`
- Created `src/cyrus/__init__.py` with `__version__ = "0.0.0"`
- Created `src/cyrus/py.typed` (PEP 561 marker)
- Created `LICENSE` (MIT, 2026, Mo Hendawy)
- Created `README.md` (skeleton with pre-alpha status notice)
- Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` (dev setup, test instructions, PR guidelines)
- Created `.gitignore` (Python standard ignores)
- Created `tests/__init__.py` and `tests/test_placeholder.py` (2 tests: assert True + import cyrus)
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (matrix: Win/macOS/Linux × Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, `fail-fast: false`)

**Task 2 (GitHub repo creation + CI verification) — DEFERRED:**
- Deferred pending user action: GitHub org `getcyrus` must be created
- Deviation from plan: URLs updated from `Mo-Hendawy/cyrus` to `getcyrus/cyrus` per user decision
  (user requested using a GitHub Organization rather than personal account for better open-source positioning)

## Verification (Local Only)

- `python -m tomllib` parse: pyproject.toml is valid
- `python -m pip install -e .` succeeds — package installs with zero dependencies
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — 2 tests OK
- `python -c "import cyrus; print(cyrus.__version__)"` — prints `0.0.0`

## Files Created

### key-files.created

- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/cyrus/__init__.py`
- `src/cyrus/py.typed`
- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `tests/__init__.py`
- `tests/test_placeholder.py`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Requirements Addressed

- **SETUP-02** ✓ — pyproject.toml declares Python 3.11+, uses hatchling, has zero runtime dependencies
- **SETUP-03** ✓ (config complete, not yet running in CI) — CI matrix file exists with Win/macOS/Linux × 3.11/3.12/3.13
- **SETUP-04** ⚠ — LICENSE/README/CONTRIBUTING files exist locally but NOT yet pushed to GitHub repo (blocked on user creating `getcyrus` org)

## Deviations

1. **Org name change**: Plan hardcoded `github.com/Mo-Hendawy/cyrus`. User subsequently decided to use GitHub organization `getcyrus` for better open-source positioning. All URLs updated to `github.com/getcyrus/cyrus`. Plan 00-02 will need to match.

2. **Task 2 deferred**: Creating the GitHub repo and running CI is blocked on user creating the `getcyrus` org. This must happen outside Claude Code (requires GitHub login).

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

Before Plan 00-02 can run:
1. Create GitHub organization: https://github.com/organizations/new → name: `getcyrus`
2. Run `gh auth refresh -s admin:org` (for CLI access to the new org)
3. Resume with: `gh repo create getcyrus/cyrus --public --source . --push` from workspace root

Then Plan 00-02 handles PyPI publishing.

## Self-Check: PASSED (with scope deviation)
- All local scaffolding tasks complete and verified
- Plan intent honored (scaffold the repo, enforce locked decisions)
- Scope deviation flagged: Task 2 (GitHub push) deferred, not silently skipped
