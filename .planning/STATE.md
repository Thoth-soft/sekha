# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-07)

**Core value:** The AI actually follows rules you give it — enforcement at the system level via PreToolUse hooks, not "trust the model to remember."
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Setup & Naming Gate

## Current Position

Phase: 0 (Setup & Naming Gate) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: Executing Phase 0
Last activity: 2026-04-12 -- Phase 0 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 0]: Two blockers must be resolved before any code is written: (a) pick a real PyPI name from the available shortlist (`cyrus-cc`, `cyrus-hook`, `cyrus-rules`, or rename); (b) bump Python minimum from 3.9 to 3.11 (3.9 EOL Oct 2025).
- [Roadmap]: Hook ships in Phase 4, before the MCP server in Phase 5. The hook is the differentiator and must be dogfooded early — failing here saves the whole project.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 0 is a non-code decision gate. Success criteria are "decisions logged + names reserved + scaffolding exists," not "tests pass."

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **Phase 0 blocker — PyPI name conflict**: `cyrus` and 7+ variants are taken. Must pick from shortlist before any public commitment.
- **Phase 0 blocker — Python 3.9 EOL**: PROJECT.md says 3.9+ but 3.9 is end-of-life. Bump minimum to 3.11.
- **Phase 4 hard CI gate (deferred to Phase 4)**: `cyrus hook bench` must hit p50 < 50ms and p95 < 150ms on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If Windows cold-start blows the budget, the project pivots or dies.
- **Phase 5 hard CI lint gate (deferred to Phase 5)**: `grep -r 'print(' src/cyrus/server.py src/cyrus/tools.py` must return zero results.
- **Phase 6 hard release gate (deferred to Phase 6)**: Fresh-VM install test on Windows + macOS + Linux must succeed end-to-end with no manual fixups.
