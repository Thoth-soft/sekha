"""Cyrus rules engine — pure-logic matcher for tool-scoped rules.

Public surface:
- Rule: frozen dataclass representing a compiled rule
- load_rules(rules_dir, hook_event, tool_name) -> list[Rule]
- evaluate(rules, tool_input) -> Rule | None
- test_rule(rule_name, tool_name, tool_input) -> dict  (dry-run)
- clear_cache() -> None

load_rules reads from disk (with mtime-based cache) and filters to rules
matching the given (hook_event, tool_name). evaluate is a pure function over
an already-loaded rule list — no I/O inside. This split is deliberate: the
Phase 4 PreToolUse hook wants load_rules on startup / on rule-dir change and
evaluate on every tool call, hot-path-friendly.

Precedence (RULES-05): block severity beats warn; within the same severity
the highest priority wins; within the same (severity, priority) the first
rule by sorted filename wins AND a tie warning is logged to stderr naming
every tied rule.

Cache (RULES-06): keyed on (file_count, max_mtime) of *.md files in the
rules dir. Touching or adding any .md file invalidates. We cache the FULL
parsed rule list per directory (not per hook_event/tool filter) so changing
the filter arguments reuses the same parse. clear_cache() drops everything
and forces a re-parse on the next load.

Pause (RULES-08): CYRUS_PAUSE is a comma-separated list of rule names to
suppress. Read every load_rules call so tests can flip it per-test.

Strict parsing (RULES-02): invalid frontmatter / unknown severity / broken
regex is logged loudly to stderr and skipped — never silently ignored. The
offending filename and the reason both appear in the log.

# Requirement coverage (Phase 3 / RULES-*):
#   RULES-01: Rule file format + required fields — _parse_rule_file
#   RULES-02: Strict parsing, loud stderr, skip-don't-silence — _load_all
#   RULES-03: Tool-scoped matching + "*" wildcard — load_rules filter
#   RULES-04: Anchored-by-default regex — _anchor_pattern + anchored frontmatter
#   RULES-05: block > warn, priority, first-match tie + log — evaluate
#   RULES-06: Compile cache keyed on dir mtime + count — _CACHE + _dir_cache_key
#   RULES-07: test_rule() dry-run — public function
#   RULES-08: CYRUS_PAUSE env var override — _paused_names
