"""`cyrus init` implementation.

One-shot setup. Ensures ~/.cyrus/ exists with the 5-category subdir layout,
writes the default config.json, and merges the PreToolUse hook registration
into ~/.claude/settings.json. Idempotent: running twice produces exactly
one cyrus hook entry in settings.json and leaves existing user data intact.

Separated from cli.py so tests can drive the full flow via `_init.run([])`
without going through argparse again. cli.py's "init" subcommand is a thin
shim that calls this run().

Design invariants:
- Status messages go to stderr via say(); stdout is reserved for the single
  user-facing directive (the `claude mcp add` hint) so scripts can pipe it.
- settings.json is backed up BEFORE any merge so a broken merge never
  destroys the user's prior config. The backup lives next to the file with
  a timestamped suffix -- humans can recover it by hand.
- Merge logic is idempotent: merge_claude_settings returns changed=False
  when the cyrus command is already present, and the file is not rewritten.
- Every output byte is pure ASCII (cp1252 safe on Windows cmd.exe).
