"""Private helpers for cyrus.search: ReDoS watchdog + scoring primitives.

This module is private — the public API lives in `cyrus.search`. It owns:
- the regex-metachar detection heuristic (is_literal_query) that lets us
  avoid the ReDoS watchdog entirely for plain-substring queries,
- the 30-day-half-life recency decay and the filename_bonus multiplier that
  together with term frequency form the final score,
- the per-line snippet extractor with 120-char truncation, and
- the threaded scan_file_with_timeout that kills pathological regex matches
  (e.g. `(a+)+b` against long 'a' runs) at 100ms wall-clock rather than
  letting a single hostile file freeze the whole search.

Stdlib only. All logs go to stderr via cyrus.logutil.get_logger — never
stdout, because the MCP server protocol stream owns stdout.
