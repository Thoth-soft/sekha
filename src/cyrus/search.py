"""Public full-text search API for Cyrus. Stdlib-only.

    search(query, category=None, limit=10, since=None, tags=None)
        -> list[SearchResult]

Scoring is `tf * recency_decay(age_days) * filename_bonus(query, path)` —
formulas and constants live in cyrus._searchutil. Walks the cyrus_home()
tree with `os.walk`, filters on category / updated / tags, then scores
surviving files. Regex queries are routed through the _searchutil ReDoS
guard; literal queries (no regex metacharacters) take a faster
substring-count path.

This module is the bedrock the Phase 5 MCP server's `cyrus_search` tool
imports directly. Keep the public surface stable — callers depend on the
SearchResult dataclass field names and the keyword-argument shape of
`search()`.
